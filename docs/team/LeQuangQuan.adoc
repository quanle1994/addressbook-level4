TunedIn is a free-to-use application that brings to you the power of a full-fledged command line personal organizer,
bundled together with a user-friendly interface that keeps all of your information easily accessible and at your fingertips.

*Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T14-B2/main/blob/master/collated/main/quanle1994.md[Functional
code]]

=== Enhancement Added:
* Colour tags of the same type and differentiate tags of different types
* Add Order Command
* Enhance Find Command to find all text fields
* Develop lock mechanism

==== External behavior

---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=find]

---

---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=lock]

---

=== Justification

The colouring of different tags will help users differentiate different tags associated with a contact more easily.

Ordering is essential to TunedIn. It provides the fundamental and a must-to-have functionality of an organizer.
With the ordering mechanism, user will be able to order the list of contacts in 14 different ways. This
is inline with our goal in making TunedIn as customizable as possible
and, most importantly to allow the user to organize the contacts to their most preferred way.

The find command is enhanced to search for all text fields and gives user the control over which text field to search
for, including but not limited to the contact's name. This ensures that the user can search for contacts even though
he/she cannot remember the contact's name. This is useful when remarks are attached to each contact, which can make
the search more flexible.

The Lock mechanism allows users to create user accounts that allow the programme to encrypt their contacts, enhancing
the confidentiality of the data. This is important when the computer is shared among different people, or when a user
wants to manage different lists of contacts.

=== Implementation

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=find]

---

=== External behavior

---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=group]

---

==== Justification

Group mechanism is another essential function of TunedIn. It allows the user to organize the
contacts to user specified groups.

==== Implementation

---

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=group]

---

==== External behavior

---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=list]

---

==== Justification

List can be used to show the entire list of contacts.
It is further enhanced to complement the function of group by allowing user to
view a list of contacts by group. Instead of implementing the group list view function
in the group function, it is more intuitive for the user to typed `list` followed by group
name.
