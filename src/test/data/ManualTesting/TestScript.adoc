Welcome to the test script for TunedIn. We have provided below, a comprehensive list of test commands for you to try on
the TunedIn application, along with their expected output.

Feel free to report any bugs to our official reporting channel: bugs@tunedinapp.com

== Getting Started

To commence testing for TunedIn, we have prepared for you sample data for you to load into the application to get going
right away!

Here's how to load the files into the application for testing.

* In your new copy of TunedIn app, copy the file SampleData.xml (included in this folder) into the data folder in your
TunedIn application.
** If there is a addressbook.xml or eventbook.xml file created, delete them.
* Duplicate the copied SampleData.xml file
* In the first copy, delete the lines 205 to 261. Rename the file addressbook.xml
* In the second copy, delete the lines 2 to 204. Rename the file eventbook.xml

Congratulations! You have the sample data loaded and ready to go!
